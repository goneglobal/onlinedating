# Testing Instructions

## Manual Testing
- Open the app in your browser.
- Verify user cards are displayed with name, age, and bio.
- Check that data updates if you change `db/fake_db.php`.

## Automated Testing (Optional)
- You can use PHPUnit for backend tests or Jest for frontend JS if you expand the app.
- For now, manual testing is sufficient due to the simple structure.
